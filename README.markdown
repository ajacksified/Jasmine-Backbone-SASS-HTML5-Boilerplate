Jasmine-Backbone-SASS-HTML5-Boilerplate
=======================================

A starter project that includes everything for Jasmine, SASS, Backbone, and
Mustache and the HTML5 boilerplate. It still has a little manual work to do
on deployment, like compiling and minifying the css together. Someday.

bundle install, then run:

`bundle exec guard` to convert your coffeescript and sass

`bundle exec rake jasmine` to fire up a local jasmine server on :8888
